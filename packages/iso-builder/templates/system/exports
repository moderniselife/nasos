# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#        to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# NestOS NFS Configuration
# 
# Default options used by NestOS:
# - rw: Allow both read and write requests
# - sync: Reply to requests only after the changes have been committed to stable storage
# - no_subtree_check: Disable subtree checking
# - no_root_squash: Allow root users on NFS clients to access as root
# - secure: Require requests to originate from ports less than 1024
#
# Additional shares will be configured through the NestOS control panel
# Share configurations will be added below this line

# Example share (commented out):
# /mnt/storage/public 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,all_squash)

# Include dynamically managed exports
# NestOS Control Panel will manage files in the exports.d directory
