# Security Policy

## Overview

This policy outlines our commitment to maintaining the security of our project and provides guidance on supported versions and the process for reporting vulnerabilities. As we are in the early development phase (v0.1.1.3), this policy will be updated as the project evolves.

## Supported Versions

The table below specifies which versions of our project currently receive security updates:
